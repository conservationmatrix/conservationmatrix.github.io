        <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 story">
          <p>
            We founded Conservation Matrix with a simple goal: to make it easier
            to invest in high-quality and sustainable real asset projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every dollar that flows into a sustainably managed real asset delivers 
            quantifiable and important environmental benefits.  In addition, such 
            investment opportunities are financially attractive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically these investment opportunities have been available to only 
            large institutional investors.  We are changing this through a simple and 
            transparent platform that reduces costs for both individuals and project 
            sponsors. By cutting out middlemen such as brokers and investment 
            managers who charge high fees, projects can achieve greater overall 
            returns.
          </p>
          <p>
            To execute on our vision, we have assembled what we consider to be 
            the best in class founding team and industry partners.
